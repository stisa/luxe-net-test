Luxe Net Test
=============

This is a small example of a multiplayer game, using node.js as the game server
and [luxe](https://github.com/underscorediscovery/luxe) as client.  
Currently it's based on websockets, and it only works in the browser. I plan to
add at least android as a target in the future.
There's a playable demo at [my site](http://stisa.space/luxe-net-test).
